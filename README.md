🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Predicting real estate prices is one of the most practical and insightful applications of machine learning in the modern world. This project demonstrates how Linear Regression, one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning, can be applied to estimate house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

The goal is to create a simple yet effective predictive model that can offer meaningful insights into the housing market and serve as a stepping stone into the broader field of data science and predictive analytics.

📌 Objective
The main objective of this project is to:

Build a regression model capable of predicting house prices based on historical housing data.

Understand how different features (like area, bedrooms, and bathrooms) influence pricing.

Visualize the relationships between features and target variable to support data-driven decisions.

🧠 Approach
This project follows a typical machine learning pipeline:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, formatting features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and correlations.

Model Training: Applying Scikit-learn’s Linear Regression algorithm.

Model Evaluation: Using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R² Score.

Prediction: Generating price predictions for new/custom input values.

📊 Key Features
Simple and interpretable model using Linear Regression

Real-world applicability for basic house pricing predictions

Visualization of trends and patterns in housing data

Easy extension to include more features or switch to more advanced models (like Random Forest, XGBoost)

🛠️ Tools and Libraries
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization

📈 Outcome
The final model provides house price predictions based on user-defined inputs, offering a baseline that can be expanded into a more complex real estate analysis system. This work can be a solid foundation for building more accurate models by incorporating additional features such as location, year built, or proximity to amenities.
